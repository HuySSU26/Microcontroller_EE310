PROJECT # 1
03/08/2025  Started the project: 
  Created main.asm V1.0 for Project_1/Part1.  The code is currently saved as hvac.asm in Project1_HVAC in MPLABX IDE.
  The code is working correctly for all three case of positive temperature.  Need to revise to handle negative temp.
03/09/25   Revise main.asm:
  Added function to handle negative measTemp value. Need to work on meeting requirement R9 and R10.
  Also need to work on continuously updating measTemp in REG21 as a real life HVAC system would.
  Also added 'MyConfig.inc' to Projects main branch
